- Template tags are used to write python code in html files. {% %} = Gives no output and are used for loops and such while {{ }} = output of data.

- accounts:login = app_name:URL ?

- To show different content on templates, you can use the is_authenticated method. 		
{% if user.is_authenticated %} -->show this html code {% else % } --> show this html code (<li>)

- Instead of having a dropdown, we can make an instance that connects the logged in author to the instance. 
instance = form.save(commit=False)
instance.author = request.user
instance.save() (Something like this).

Named urls 	url(r'^logout/$', views.logout_view, name="logout") <-- logout is the name of this url.

Trying to defragment and redevelop the login function more similar to the method that is presented in the Django documentation fetching username=username / pw=pw. Still using the built in functions in Django.
